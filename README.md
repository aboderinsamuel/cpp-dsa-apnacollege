# C++ Data Structures & Algorithms — short guide

A compact collection of C++ (C++17) solutions for data-structures & algorithms, organized by topic for study and interview prep.

Project layout (short)
- Folders like `01_arrays_hashing`, `02_two_pointers`, etc.
- Each `.cpp` is a standalone example/solution.
- `CMakeLists.txt` available for project builds.

Quick start
Prerequisites: C++17 compiler (g++, clang, MSVC) and CMake (optional).

Build with CMake (recommended):

```powershell
cd 'C:\Users\USER\CLionProjects\cpp-dsa-apnacollege - Copy'
mkdir -Force build; cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build . --config Release
```

Compile a single file (quick):

```powershell
cd 'C:\Users\USER\CLionProjects\cpp-dsa-apnacollege - Copy\01_arrays_hashing'
g++ -std=c++17 03_contains_duplicate.cpp -o 03_contains_duplicate.exe
.\03_contains_duplicate.exe
```

Contributing / working after forking (essentials)
- Clone your fork, add upstream, create a branch:

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/<you>/cpp-dsa-apnacollege.git
cd cpp-dsa-apnacollege
git remote add upstream https://github.com/<original>/cpp-dsa-apnacollege.git
git checkout -b feat/my-solution
```

- Add source changes and commit (avoid binaries):

```powershell
git add -- '*.cpp' '*.h' CMakeLists.txt
git commit -m "Add: short description"
git push origin feat/my-solution
```

Notes
- `.gitignore` excludes build artifacts and `*.exe` by default — do not commit compiled binaries.
- Source files generated by AI are fine to add; double-check for duplicates and meaningful names.

License
- Add a `LICENSE` file if you want to publish the project.

That's it — short and focused. If you want it even shorter or want a different tone, tell me what to remove or keep.
